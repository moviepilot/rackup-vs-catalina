RACKUP vs CATALINA
==================

This is a minimal setup (sinatra app, jruby-rack, warbler) to 
demonstrate the fact, that an OPTIONS request is not handled
by sinatra when running in Tomcat 7.

Assume the following App:

    class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
      get '/' do
        'Hello World!'
      end

      options '/' do
        headers['X-Good-Bye-World'] = 'true'
        headers['Allow'] = 'GET'
        halt 200
      end
    end

when running the app via Webrick, the following OPTIONS request work:

    $ curl -v -XOPTIONS http://localhost:4567/

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-Frame-Options: sameorigin
    X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
    Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
    X-Good-Bye-World: true
    Allow: GET
    Content-Length: 0
    Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/1.8.7/2012-02-22)
    Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2012 16:15:18 GMT
    Connection: Keep-Alive

Now trying the same request in Tomcat, it produces the following response:

    $ http options localhost:8080

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
    Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
    Content-Length: 0
    Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2012 16:17:18 GMT

The rackapp itself is correctly mounted, a GET request to / returns the 
expected response.
